# Bulk-NFTBurner-solana


This is a script for bulk burning nft on solana network with metaplex, but why? because this will give you back some SOL that was reserved for account rent.

[WARN] this script will burn all nft in your account

Source: [Metaplex Docs](https://docs.metaplex.com/guides/burn-nfts)

I copied some code from [this repo](https://github.com/Swertin/BulkNftBurnTool) and fixed it so that it is compatible with the latest version of the module.

----------------

### This code is not fully usable because there is still an error that I can't fix yet...

here is the error i got, if you can help me to fix this script i will be very grateful and maybe give you a little reward in the form of $SOL
