# bulk-nft-burner-solana


This is a script for bulk burning nft on solana network with metaplex, but why? because this will give you back some SOL that was reserved for account rent

I copied some code from [this repo](https://github.com/Swertin/BulkNftBurnTool) and fixed it so that it is compatible with the latest version of the module.

[WARN] this code is not fully usable because there is still an error that I can't fix yet
